                        University of Newfoundland (MUN) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science later in May 2024. 
                        I have completed my degree with a 3.73 GPA in 2 years and 9 months. 
                        Concerning just Comp Sci Courses, I have a record of all 'A' letter-grades, except for one 'B'. 
                    </span></h2>


                    <br>
                    <h2 class ="lead"><span>My very first programming experience started at Memorial University in Sept 2021, 
                        which was 2 years and 9 months ago. This demonstrates that I am a speedy, effective, and eager learner.
                        It may discoursage some prospective employers that I am a fresh graduate with no co-op; however,
                        considering how fast I learn and am willing to learn, even if I don't know the technology,
                         you are in it for a surprise because I will learn that technology in a blink of an eye.
                    </span></h2>
